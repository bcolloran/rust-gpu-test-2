- had trouble using rust-gpu with glam's `Vec2` type in shared code -- boiled down to missing "bytemuck" feature in glam and spirv-std dependencies in shared and shaders crates. Remember to use that!
- also, best to use the same root workspace deps e.g. glam, spirv-std, bytemuck in all crates to avoid feature and version mismatches.

## `shared` Crate
It's important that types that are shared between the CPU and GPU have identical memory layouts. This crate is included as a dependency in both the `kernel` and main application crates.

Types in this crate will include things like: push constant structs, items used in data buffers, and any other data structures that need to be shared between host and device.
