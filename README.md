- had trouble using rust-gpu with glam's `Vec2` type in shared code -- boiled down to missing "bytemuck" feature in glam and spirv-std dependencies in shared and shaders crates. Remember to use that!
- also, best to use the same root workspace deps e.g. glam, spirv-std, bytemuck in all crates to avoid feature and version mismatches.
